# malware
a fun malware ish thing, we open 2 windows of space invaders and it checks indefinatly for 2 open windows, if 1 is closed the loop catches that and automatically opens another
this makes a fun virus like program that is stuck on your computer and runs everytime you restart/power on, you can close it easily by going to task manager and ending task, so there is no real danger.
